                        <p>Unilever, a big multinational, is interested in expanding their business domain. They want to develop new products and services, with a digital component, for new markets.<br /> The design department from Unilever is asking you
                            to dive into a subculture and to look for design inspiration and possibly new design directions to develop innovative products.<br />
                            <br /> They want to know what people in the chosen subculture feel, experience and need. And what are possible design directions for new innovations that could cater to the subculture.

                        <p><b>Subculture 1: Families with young children</b><br /> This subculture is interesting to me because I love children, I would like to develop a digital product for children&rsquo;s education in the future, but I don&#39;t really
                            have any contact with families with young kids in The Netherlands.<br /> I can access this subculture by visiting petting zoos or amusement parks to do the interview as well as observation.
                            <br /> The possible events or situations that I can observe next week are on the weekend, I can go to the petting zoo near me to watch people.<br /> Contact persons: I do not know my interviewees yet, but I can ask random people
                            to interview in the petting zoo nearby where a lot of parents take their children outside to play with animals.
                            <br />
                            <br /> <b>Subculture 2: Chef</b><br /> This subculture is interesting to me because I am working in a Vietnamese restaurant as a cashier. I see the chef working at least twice a week and I found being a chef is a really interesting
                            job.
                            <br /> I can access this subculture by going to restaurants or chef contests.<br /> The possible events or situations that I can observe next week are due to coronavirus restrictions, finding a chef competition or anything
                            similar will be difficult, best would be my workplace where chefs work there.<br /> Contact persons: I can ask my two colleagues working as chefs to do the interview.<br />
                            <br /> <b>Subculture 3: Cat owners </b><br /> This subculture is interesting to me because I adore cats. I&#39;d like to see whether other cat owners share my views.<br /> I can access this subculture by going to pet stores,
                            cat caf&eacute;s, or my neighborhood. Especially in the area, I am living, I witness a lot of cats walking around.
                            <br /> The possible events or situations that I can observe next week are that I will talk to cat owners in my area.<br /> Contact persons: I do not know any friends in The Netherlands who own a cat. However, I can walk around
                            my neighborhood and ask for help.

                        <p>I chose Families with young children because my client- Unilever has developed many products for families with young children such as foods, drinks, and ice creams. They make up a large portion of my client's customers. In addition,
                            I can go to the petting zoo nearby where a lot of families with young kids gather to do the observation and interview. I am also considered Chef because according to Unilever’s website, they own Unilever Food Solutions. It
                            is an organization where chefs supporting chefs. Nevertheless, finding a chef contest or chef meeting in the current situation is difficult. Even though I have contact with two chefs, it is not enough for my observation. Therefore,
                            choosing Families with young children as subculture would be the best choice for me. </p>

                            <br /> They enjoy outside activities<br /> Parents select foods and drinks for their children carefully<br /> Parents want children to maintain healthy weight<br /> They consume a lot of foods, drinks, and ice creams on daily
                            basis
                            <br /> Parents play an important role in children&rsquo;s diets<br />
                            <br /><b> Desk research:</b><br />
                            <br /> As far as I have found, young child means a child below the 12 years of age. Through a blog post on Children&#39;s Bureau (2017), I also found that the importance of family in the development of children cannot be overstated,
                            including eating behaviors. Parents and others have an impact on children&#39;s eating preferences and openness to try new foods. In addition, according to researchers, ultra-processed foods contributed 67 percent of calories
                            ingested by children and adolescents in the U.S. in 2018 (Nunez,2021) . To summarize, not all of my beliefs about families with young children are correct. As an illustration, parents believed themselves to be the most responsible
                            for addressing obesity in children, despite their lack of knowledge about the subject (Vittrup &amp; McClure, 2018). Many parents and children were overweight, according to the research, however most parents mislabeled their
                            overweight and obese children as being of normal weight. Healthy eating, portion sizes, physical activity guidelines, obesity trends, and health hazards were all areas where parents expressed uncertainty and a lack of information.<br
                            /> I feel that by reading the blog and the newspaper article mentioned above, I will have a better understanding of the subject and gain further background knowledge. Finally, I picked the scholarly article because it allows
                            a researcher to speak about his or her study with other scholars in the area. They are frequently peer-reviewed by experts in the subject to verify that the content is current and correct. By integrating all three, I am able
                            to evaluate this subculture from a variety of perspectives.<br />

                            <br /> How do parents select ultra-processed foods and drinks for their children?<br /> What are criteria for them to choose those products?<br /> What parents actually know and want to learn about the impact of ultra-processed
                            foods and beverages on young children?

                            <br /> At a grocery store: they sell ultra-processed foods and drinks here so a lot of parents may go there and select meals and drinks for their kids. I will go to the grocery store near my house this weekend to observe. I
                            believe that this activity will take me around 2 hours.

                            <br /> For the grocery store, I think it&#39;s a good opportunity to observe a big number of parents at once and see how they select ultra-processed foods and beverages for their children.
                            <br />
                            <br /> <b>Observation style:</b><br /> My observation style is` non-participant and overt observation. Because I want to pay close attention to what they&#39;re going to do and how they&#39;re going to choose ultra-foods and
                            beverages.

                        <p>In general, I believe I have gained a better understanding of families with young children. I succeed to know frozen pizza, packaged snacks, and soft drinks are the most popular ultra-processed foods items among families with young
                            kids. Only a few parents looked at nutrition on the package before deciding to buy a food product for their kids. Most of them looked at the food brand and put it right away in their basket. Parents were much more likely to
                            view the information at the top of the Nutrition Facts panel (calories and fat, for instance) than the components at the bottom (vitamins and minerals). However, it’s not easy to approach parents to ask for their permission
                            to take a picture of them and their process to choose ultra-foods or beverages for their children. Only a few of them are happy to help me to conduct my observation.

                            <br /> My interviewee is Hang. She is living in my neighborhood. One day I saw her playing with her kids
                            <br /> on the playground, I asked her to do the interview, and she said yes. The interview will, of course,
                            <br /> be conducted in English and in person. She has two children: a seven- year-old son and a five- year-old daughter.<br />
                            <br /> Relevance of participant&rsquo;s profile:<br /> I chose this person because interviewing strangers gives me a chance to meet and learn about new people. It&rsquo;s better to hear stories from new people and gather new
                            insights than people I already know. In addition, she has two kids so she knows about ultra-processed foods and drinks for young children and can share her knowledge to fulfill my curiosities.

                            <br /> Good morning! Welcome to today&#39;s interview. First, let me introduce myself. My name is Uyen, and I&#39;m a student at The Hague University of Applied Sciences. I&#39;d like to express my appreciation to you for taking
                            the time to participate in this 30-minute interview. Today, I am going to ask you some questions on a subculture on which I&#39;m conducting research: Families with young children. Your basic personal information will be written
                            in the journal, your information and data will be kept fully private from anyone who has no relation to the research. I will not share it with anybody else except my tutor. Please inform me right away if you encounter any discomfort
                            throughout the interview.<br />
                            <br /><b> During the interview:</b><br /> Let&rsquo;s start with the first question! Can you introduce yourself?<br /> Tell me what you know about ultra-processed foods and beverages.
                            <br /> Tell me about the first time your child consumed ultra-processed foods and beverages.
                            <br /> How often do you buy ultra-processed foods and beverages for your kids?
                            <br /> How do you feel about ultra-processed food and drink products for kids now available on the market
                            <br /> What are criteria to pick ultra-processed foods and drinks for your kids<br /> Why do you select ultra-processed foods instead of fresh food for your children?<br /> Which ultra-processed foods and beverages do you usually
                            buy for them?<br /> Do you read the nutrition ingredients on the package?<br /> What benefits may we get from ultra-processed meals and beverages?<br /> Why must children be aware of over-consumed unhealthy foods?<br /> This
                            is the last question! How do you educate kids on the impact of ultra-processed foods and drinks?
                            <br />
                            <br /> <b>After the interview:</b><br /> Thank you again for taking part in this interview. I have gathered a lot of useful information; please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions. I will not share your
                            personal information to anyone, and the data will be utilized in the course &quot;Research for Design.&quot;

                            me know immediately. We are about to start, are you ready?<br />
                            <br /> <b>During interview:</b><br /> Let&rsquo;s start with the first question! Could you tell me about the eating routine of your kids during the pandemic?<br /> How did COVID impact your kids&rsquo; food behavior and consumption?<br
                            /> What did you do to support nutrition for your kids during the pandemic?<br /> Tell me about the difficult challenges you faced for changing eat habits in your children during the pandemic. After that, I&#39;ll ask follow-up
                            questions depending on her answer.
                            <br /> How did you overcome those difficulties? More follow-up questions to learn more about the solutions, as well as some insights into how she chose meals and drinks for her children throughout the pandemic.<br />

                            the eating habits of children during the pandemic throughout this interview. It is beneficial to my research. I&#39;d like to tell you that I&#39;ll be using the information from this interview and the record in my research
                            journal for academic purposes exclusively. And I&#39;m not trying to inform anyone but my lecturer about it. I wish you a great day and goodbye!<br /> &nbsp;

                        <p>I struggled with the affinity diagram since I wasn't sure which data cards to combine. However, I attempted to connect them by rearranging the clusters several times until I arrived at my final affinity diagram, which consisted
                            of four clusters. And after I was through with my diagram, I showed it to my classmates and received some really useful feedback. To be honest, I had previously considered the insights while creating the clusters for the diagram,
                            so finishing this section did not take me long.

                            examples. Because I only know what the general consensus among parents is on ad breaks on television, ultra-processed food is incredibly tempting to children. I&#39;m not sure whether parents are truly opposed to such advertising.
                            <br />
                            <br /> Steps suggested: To obtain the above-mentioned missing information, I would conduct an ethnographic interview. This is because the interviewee is the one who truly conducts the conversation in an ethnographic interview.
                            I believe the interviewee feels more at ease when they are permitted to freely tell their story in whichever way they like ( still stick with the interview&rsquo;s objective). I&#39;ll start by asking them a general question
                            about the ultra-processed food commercial breaks on television, and then I&#39;ll follow their stories to learn more.<br /> &nbsp;
